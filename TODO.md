# Todo

- [ ] configure undotree (diff on the bottom)
- [ ] Think of a better workflow for oil
    - [ ] If possible to add git icons (modified, not commited etc) in oil, we can substitute the tree for it (folders folding would be interesting too)
- [ ] Custom Luasnippets (follow [Teej Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNWx-ym7jjI&t=226s)

# Kickstart
When revamped kickstart release, revamp all my config (using the import and modularization tips from kickstart comments)
