# Todo
- [ ] Check what [mini plugins](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) would work for me
- [ ] Custom Luasnippets (follow [Teej Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNWx-ym7jjI&t=226s)
- [ ] Change harpoon window size (more height, less width)
- [ ] Create good workflow for diffview (daily nvim plugin guy have a video on it, and on oil too, maybe it is worth to watch)
- [ ] Spectre `<leader>q` has a ocupied keymap, deal with it so that `<leader>q` closes the buffer
- [ ] Harpoon `<leader>tab` not cicles in the list, only gets to the end and stops. Fix it
