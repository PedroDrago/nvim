# Nvim

These are my neovim configurations files in lua. They started with [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). If you're too lazy to build your configs from scratch and don't want a bloated distribution like [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) or [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) I strongly recommend just using kickstart.

If you want to learn how to create from scratch your own neovim configuration files watch this [Typecraft Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn) Neovim configuration, they're great.

### Install 
**Warning: This command will delete your current `/nvim` directory, be careful**
