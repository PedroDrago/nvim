# Nvim

This are my neovim configurations files in lua. They started with [nvim kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), then modularized in several files.

If you want to learn how to create from scratch your own neovim configuration files watch [Typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev) videos about Neovim, they're great.

### Install 
**Warning: This command will delete your current `/nvim` directory, be careful**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim && git clone git@github.com:PedroDrago/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
