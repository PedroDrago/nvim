- [ ] Find a way to dinamically disable whole treesitter plugin in large files (faster.nvim and bigfile.nvim are not working). The ideal would be that some features dinamically disable when opening large BUFFERS, without the need of starting vim again only for that file. Disable features like LSP, cmp and treesitter (completely, 100% of the plugin disabled, speacially treesitter)

- [ ] Find a good setup to copilot:
    - [ ] Disabled by default.
    - [ ] ctrl+tab[?] to complete
    - [ ] cmp integration[?]
